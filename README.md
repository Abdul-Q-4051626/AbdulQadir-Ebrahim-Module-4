Module-4.
The API that I built in module 4 is 'Location Services'.
The function of the Location Services in my app is to provide my customers with the locations of my branches located around Cape Town.
The google maps locations can be accessed throught the 'Contact us' button on the dashboard.
Thereafter a cutsomer will be directed to a screen labelled 'Contact us'. 
On the 'Contact us' screen, there will be a numbers ways our cutsomers can reach us, on of them being a link that directs them to a 
'Google maps' screen that displays several branches around Cape Town.
Our customers can then reach out to use by following the google maps location service if they require assistance in any area.
